"Element of Style" is a classic guide for writing non-fiction. The author emphasizes clear and concise writing to ensure readers can easily understand the writer's ideas. 

To write clearly, we must sharpen our writing skills. Writing well is a reflection of clear thinking. Beginners often struggle to improve without guidance from a professional writer who can show them how to write effectively and revise their work.

Gen AI has brought us the potential for an instant, effective teacher by our side. With a simple input of the author's advice, we can ask AI to revise our articles. Inspired by this concept, I have created [StyleCraft](https://elementofstyle-kstx54psajqbz7kutxu6ba.streamlit.app/), a tool that allows you to try out this process. You can also view the source code [here](https://github.com/andyxinyuwu/element_of_style) (only 62 lines). StyleCraft is designed to benefit anyone, especially students, who wish to improve their writing skills through immediate examples. It can be used for various forms of non-fiction writing, such as work emails, product documents, research papers, or personal blogs. Enjoy!
